; compute some statistics for "INBOX" of account "tim at w-h"
; NB: when I upped the count examined from 10 to 100 the real time spent was 3+ seconds, up from 3- seconds
; when I upped it from 100 to 1000, time elapsed was about 4.4s
; however, at 1000 I noticed that stats on "to" are not very interesting: I get all the different combinations incuding various spellings of myself
; from is still interesting and I think the next project will be looking at date sent collapsed into year or year-month, I suspect
